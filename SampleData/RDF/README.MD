# Air-Routes RDF Data

This folder contains two files of SPARQL INSERT DATA commands that were generated by running `mk-sparql.rb` against the `air-routes-latest-nodes.csv` 
and `air-routes-latest-edges.csv` files. You may also be interested in the [AWS CSV2RDF](https://github.com/aws/amazon-neptune-csv-to-rdf-converter) 
tool which can turn CSV files into NQuad format RDF files.
