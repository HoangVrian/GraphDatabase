# Scripts to make SQL INSERT statements
The Ruby scripts in this folder can be used to create files of SQL INSERT statements 
that enable the `air-route` data to be loaded into relational databases. 
Each file has a comment block that describes how to use the script within. 
The input to these scripts can be generated using 
the MakeRouteGraph (mrg.rb) application.
